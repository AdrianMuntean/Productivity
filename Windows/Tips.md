 - <b>SWITCHING BETWEEN INSTANCES OF THE SAME APP</b> - I worked for a while in Ubuntu and the Linux-based OS had a cool feature that I used a lot: The key combination <code>Alt</code> + <code>`</code> changes betweeen two open apps of the same type. For example, if I have two open instance of an IDE , then I want to go through them only. If I use <code>Alt</code> + <code>Tab</code> this would iterate through all of my open apps. When I moved to Windows this feature was missing. 
    - One workaround for this would be to use <code>WinButton</code> + <code>n</code> (where <code>n</code> represents the index of the app in the taskbar)
    - Another approach will be to use third party solutions for this. I found [EasySwitch](https://neosmart.net/EasySwitch/) which does this exact thing. It works as expected.
